// Is there a method to capitalize a string, for ex. atlas to Atlas?

string = "mountain";

capitalizedString = string[0].toUpperCase() + string.substring(1);

console.log(capitalizedString);

// There is no built in method to capitalize all the first letters of a word, but I put in a
// solution to do so above.
