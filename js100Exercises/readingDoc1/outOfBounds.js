// What happens if we take the array ['fish', 'and', 'chips'] and try to access the element
// at index position 10? Try this in JavaScript.

arr = ["fish", "and", "chips"];

console.log(arr[10]);

// JavaScript will return "undefined" because it is out of bounds. This is the same
// thing that happens when you try to call a property on an object that doesn't exist.
