// Predict the output of the folowing code:

if (true && false) {
  console.log("Yes!");
} else {
  console.log("No....");
}

// The out put here is going to be 'No' because && is the logical AND operator, which
// requires both conditions to return truthy values in order for the expression to
// evaluate to true.
