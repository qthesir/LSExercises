// Recall all values that count as falsy in JavaScript:

// 0
// -0
// null
// undefined
// ''
// [] (wrong)
// {} (wrong)
// NaN
// 0n
// False

// Correction: [] and {} are not falsey values. False is a falsy value, obviously, and I
// missed that. 0n is also a falsey value, and I missed that as well.
