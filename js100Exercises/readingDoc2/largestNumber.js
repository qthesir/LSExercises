// Using the documentation, determine how we can find the largest numeric value that

maxVal = Number.MAX_VALUE;

console.log(maxVal);

// I also found a property of Number called MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, which is the largest number
// that can be processed and compared with precision. Hm... I wonder what's going on
// under the hood here? Definitely curious.
