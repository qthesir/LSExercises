// Find the MDN documentation on operator precedence, and use it to find out which
// result the expression evaluates to:

answer = 4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10;

// Initial guess:

guess = (4 * 5) + ((3 ** 2) / 10);

console.log(answer, guess);

// I was correct. Here is the doc: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence
